# Hi, I'm Gokhan 👋

I’m a Product Analytics–focused **Data Engineer** with 7+ years of experience designing  
metric-ready datasets, scalable pipelines, and semantic models that power activation,  
engagement, and growth decisions across product and marketing surfaces.

I specialize in building reliable data foundations — from event instrumentation and  
tracking validation to medallion/lakehouse modeling and LLM-powered automation.
